Final Project: Peer Evaluation Tool
Background
In classes with a team component, such as 3901, peer evaluations are important component of the grading rubric. The feedback from these evaluations is useful to the instructor for assigning a score to an individual student, as well as to the students for receiving constructive criticism from their peers.

=======

A web application would streamline the collection, collation, and analysis of these peer evaluations.

Required Features
1. A user should be able to submit scores and comments for all of their teammates (and only their teammates). The application should support multiple peer evaluations over the semester (eg, for each project).

2. An administrative interface should provide the instructor/TA with an easy, intuitive way to populate the class with names and email addresses from a roster and also create the respective teams.

3. An administrative interface should give a useful view of the scores assigned within a team. This view should support the instructor's need to assign scores to individuals based on these evaluations, as well as quickly detect potential problems that warrant intervention.

Extensions
The following list is not exhaustive. The goal is to create as useful an application as possible, so the following are some challenges that could be addressed to that end. You are encouraged to think of other improvements that would be useful.

1. Authentication/login. Peer evaluations should be connected to an authenticated user, preventing forging of evaluations.

2. Admin dashboard to monitor submission of peer evaluations and simplify sending reminders or managing evaluations that are never submitted.

3. Support for multiple group structures. A student may belong to multiple groups simultaneously (eg a "project group" and a "technology team" as in 3901).

4. Changing enrollment. Students might add or drop the course and this should be handled cleanly by the tool.

5. Audience evaluation of presentations. A related, but different, peer evaluation is the feedback an audience provides for a presentation. This kind of evaluation is not quite the same as peer evaluation because it isn't an n-squared evaluation matrix of team-mates evaluating each other. Instead, it is the rest of the class evaluating n presenters. Is it possible to integrate this kind of evaluation seemlessly with the core functionality of peer evaluation described above?
